TO SEARCH:
WHY won't this.gridWidth work or why can't I refer to this instead of using controller when the method refers to another
property.


Tasks Needed:
Onload, generate coordinates of ships;
Store coordinates onto an array.
Onclick/onkeypress, convert coordinates from A0 to 00 as ex;
Compare coordinate with those in array;
	If missed, then give message of missed, show miss image, increase counter of shots used;
	If hit, give message of hit, show ship.png into table, test if hit before: increase hit counter and mark array true,
	increase counter of shots used.
When all ships have been destroyed,
	show message of vitory, show number of hits and accuracy, end game.




Possible ideas:
Add timer - repair ships on its own after a certain amount of tries, add different weapons
